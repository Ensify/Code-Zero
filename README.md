## Project Description

### Problem Statement
Haze and smoke is a definite hindrance to any fire rescue mission. There has been many cases where fire hazard victims couldn't be rescued as they couldn't be spotted. Firefighters risk their lives to save others, having partial vision due to smoke and haze further increases the risks and effectiveness of the rescue mission. Introducing a revolutionary solution that empowers firefighters in their life-saving missions. An intelligent AI/ML based realtime dehazing system.

### Solution
A cutting-edge Generative AI based intelligent de-smoking/de-hazing algorithm that can be integrated into real-time video processing mobile systems which can enhance the visibility of indoor fire hazard areas during rescue operations, ensuring the safety and efficiency of first responders and improving the chances of successful rescue missions.
